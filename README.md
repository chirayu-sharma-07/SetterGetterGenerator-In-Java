# SetterGetterGenerator-In-Java

AIM :
Some of the IDE provides facility of generating Setter/Getter methods. I have developed this functionality in Java so that you can generate Setter/Getter without using any IDE and it will save alot of time if your class has so many properties.

Folders Description :
src folder contains source code.
classes folder contains compiled code.
dist folder contains jar file for the distribution in market.
testcases folder contains the file which will use our functionality.

How to Use :
stay in testcases folder, make the class for that you want to generate Setter/Getter and compile your code so that class file can be generated. Now compile.bat file contains all the necessary commands so you have to simply run it and your desired code will be generated in tmp.tmp file.

ThankYou :)
